    "### The concept of the niimage\n",
    "In `nilearn`, we try to make data handling as easy as possible. While you can manually load nifti files and look inside them using `nibabel` (we will do this), `nilearn` accepts simple file paths to the data in almost all cases. When it receives a file path or a list of file paths, it knows it will need to load the file or files indicated.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The nilearn datasets\n",
    "Nilearn provides easy access to a variety of free, publicly available datasets. Helper functions are available to download them from the Internet. They are downloaded to a specific folder, and the filenames are listed in the output of the helper functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a moment to discover the datasets via tab-completion:\n",
    "`from nilearn.datasets import <TAB>`\n",

    "## Masking the neuroimaging data - the connection to scikit-learn\n",
    "\n",
    "Neuroimaging data of the brain is most often in volume form: One image is a 3D voxel-image. Since the relevant region is always inscribed in a cube of voxels, it is probable that many of the voxels do not interest us - either because they are outside the brain or outside a region of interest in the brain that we have specified. In order to restrict ourselves to the voxels that interest us, we have to mask.\n",
    "\n",
    "A mask is a binary image that contains a 1 for each position that we would like to keep and a 0 for each position we would like to discard.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the shape we are masking doesn't necessarily have to be a cube, we do not order the result spatially anymore: We just enumerate the positions of interest, and these will appear as columns in the masked data.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we are masking several images at once (i.e. a 4D image e.g. (x, y, z, t)), then the result will be a table (2D array), each line of which is once masked 3D image. This format is perfect for use with scikit-learn, as we will see.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What if we don't have a mask, but would like to restrict ourselves to the brain?\n",
    "Glad you asked. This situation happens regularly and nilearn provides an elegant solution. If no mask is specified, the `NiftiMasker` can estimate it by itself and more often than not finds a good segmentation of brain/not-brain to continue with, in addition to bringing the data into the right format for scikit-learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start by taking a look at how this works and by verifying the mask image afterwards.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Import the `NiftiMasker` from `nilearn.input_data`\n",
    "2. Instantiate one of them and call it `masker`\n",
    "3. Fit the masker to the functional data by using its method `fit` and providing the functional data file.\n"

The best strategy to separate brain voxels from non-brain-voxels actually highly depends on the type of brain data that is input. The default setting for the masker is set such that certain brain maps out of SPM are segmented correctly. That is not the case here, so we need to switch the masking strategy:\n",
